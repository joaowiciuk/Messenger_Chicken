# What is this?

This program (Messenger Chicken) is a simple TCPR client so people can connect to servers with TCPR, all made in rust.
Currently it only works on windows (.exe might work on linux with wine?), once I figure out how to compile rust for linux, I'll include it in the release section.

If your on linux and would like to use it, you can compile the source code your self. (or wait)

# Why?

I couldn't find any open source TCPR client for KAG, so i made my own, so other people can use it.

# Why rust?

I've been interested in learning rust for a while, so something simple like this is a good place to start

# Can i help?

Go for it, add new features, make your own fork, review code, tell me whats good / bad with how i've written it, anything is fine with me.

# Todo
- Move to a GUI for easier \/
- Make text stick to the bottom of the console
- Add colours?
- Add quit commands
- Let you save servers to quickly connect back
- Don't let the program crash if server is not found
