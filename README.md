# What is this?

This program (Messenger Chicken) is a simple TCPR client so people can connect to servers with TCPR, all made in rust.
Currently it only works on windows (.exe might work on linux with wine?), once I figure out how to compile rust for linux, I'll include it in the release section.

If your on linux and would like to use it, you can compile the source code your self. (or wait)

# Why?

I couldn't find any open source TCPR client for KAG, so i made my own, so other people can use it.
